# Accuracy test - Minitrack LX3
Accuracy test of the Astro mount Minitrack LX3.
Last winter the astro mount froze at -20Â°C and I lost an hour of photos in the cold.
The script measures the correlation between mechanical and acoustic methods. 
This correlation will help to get a more precise field adjustment and control of the astro mount.
